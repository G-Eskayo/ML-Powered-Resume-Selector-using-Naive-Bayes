# Resume Selector with Naive Bayes

This repository contains a Coursera course project implementing a **Naive Bayes classifier** for resume selection. The notebook demonstrates how to preprocess text data, train a classification model, and evaluate performance using Python’s `scikit-learn` library.

---

## 📘 Overview

The project titled **“Resume Selector with Naive Bayes”** focuses on applying text classification techniques to identify relevant resumes for specific job categories. The notebook follows a complete workflow — reading the dataset, transforming textual data, and building a probabilistic model using **Naive Bayes**.

## 🧠 Steps in the Notebook

1. **Import Libraries** – Uses `numpy`, `pandas`, and `scikit-learn`.
2. **Load Dataset** – Reads a dataset of resumes (the exact dataset is not shown in the PDF).
3. **Text Preprocessing** – Converts raw text to lowercase and vectorizes it.
4. **Model Training** – Trains a `MultinomialNB` classifier.
5. **Model Evaluation** – Computes model accuracy and a confusion matrix.
   - ⚠️ *Exact accuracy and confusion matrix values could not be extracted from the PDF, as they appear as images or non-selectable output cells.*

## 🧰 Tools and Libraries

- Python 3  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

*(Only libraries confirmed in the provided notebook are listed.)*

## 📊 Results

The notebook outputs model accuracy and confusion matrix results.  
However, the **exact numeric values are not present in the PDF text**, so they are intentionally excluded here to ensure factual accuracy.
